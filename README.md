# Samuel-Afon
README

My name is Samuel Afon, I was born on December 4 2003 (in Nigeria) . I major in Information Technology at UNT, Denton, Tx
I currently hope to be a web developer, but I am also interested in being a photographer. 
As of 12/28/2024 I have decided to start work on my personal website that showcases both of my major skills (photography, and web development)
The purpose of this website is to showcase my photography work (photography portfolio), sell posters/prints of my photos, allow booking for photoshoots, and the site itself will serve as a portfolio for my skills in web development... I feel confident that i now know the tools required to make this website possible, and i hope and pray its impressive enough to land me a good paying job.
